# Design Guidelines for AI-Powered QR Code Monitoring System

## Design Approach
**System-Based Approach**: Material Design 3 - optimized for data-heavy enterprise applications with clean, functional aesthetics suitable for railway infrastructure monitoring.

## Key Design Principles
- **Professional Authority**: Instill confidence through clean, systematic design
- **Data Clarity**: Prioritize information hierarchy and readability
- **Operational Efficiency**: Quick access to critical monitoring functions
- **Indian Railways Branding**: Subtle incorporation of railway heritage colors

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Deep Railway Blue: `220 85% 25%` (headers, primary actions)
- Steel Blue: `210 40% 45%` (secondary elements)

**Status Indicators:**
- Success Green: `120 60% 35%` (operational fittings)
- Warning Orange: `35 85% 55%` (maintenance due)
- Alert Red: `0 75% 50%` (critical issues)

**Neutral Foundation:**
- Background: `220 15% 97%` (light mode)
- Surface: `220 10% 99%` (cards, panels)
- Text Primary: `220 25% 15%`
- Text Secondary: `220 15% 45%`

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Headers**: 600 weight, larger scale
- **Body**: 400 weight, 16px base
- **Data/Numbers**: 500 weight for emphasis

### Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing**: Consistent use of units 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
- `p-4, m-6, gap-8` for standard component spacing
- `p-2` for tight spacing in data tables
- `p-12` for generous section padding

### Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Top navigation bar with Railway logo and system title
- Sidebar navigation for main sections (Dashboard, Scanning, Reports)
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep pages

**Data Display:**
- Status cards with color-coded borders
- Data tables with alternating row colors
- Progress indicators for inspection timelines
- Badge components for fitting status

**Forms:**
- Material Design input fields with floating labels
- Dropdown selectors for fitting types and vendors
- File upload areas with drag-and-drop styling
- Primary action buttons in Railway Blue

**Overlays:**
- Modal dialogs for detailed fitting information
- Toast notifications for system alerts
- Confirmation dialogs for critical actions

## Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Full sidebar navigation, multi-column dashboards
- **Tablet**: Collapsible sidebar, stacked dashboard cards
- **Mobile**: Bottom navigation, single-column layout

## Visual Hierarchy
- **High Priority**: Status alerts, critical maintenance items
- **Medium Priority**: Recent activities, pending inspections
- **Low Priority**: Historical data, system information

## Images
**Hero Section**: None - prioritize immediate access to monitoring tools
**Supporting Images**: 
- Railway track icons for navigation
- QR code placeholder graphics
- Chart/graph visualizations for data insights
- Small vendor/manufacturer logos in fitting details

This design framework emphasizes operational clarity while maintaining the professional standards expected in railway infrastructure management systems.
