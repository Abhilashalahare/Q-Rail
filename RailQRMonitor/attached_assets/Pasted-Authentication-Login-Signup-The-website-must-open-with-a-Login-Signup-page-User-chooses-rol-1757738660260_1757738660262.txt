Authentication (Login / Signup)

The website must open with a Login / Signup page.

User chooses role at signup:

Vendor (manufacturer of parts)

Railway Official (inspector/maintenance/admin staff)

After login, redirect the user to the correct dashboard depending on role.

Store credentials in dummy JSON/mock database (no real backend required).

👨‍🏭 Vendor Workflow (After Login as Vendor)

Vendor Dashboard

Form to enter manufacturing details for each part:

Part type (elastic rail clip / liner / pad / sleeper).

Manufacturing location.

Material composition.

Lot number (auto-generated or manual).

Date of manufacture.

Expiry date.

Submit form → system generates a Unique QR Code.

QR Code is shown on screen + downloadable image (this simulates what would be engraved on the part).

Vendor Records Page (Optional)

Table of all parts the vendor has created with generated QR codes.

Ability to view/download past QR codes.

🚉 Railway Official Workflow (After Login as Official)

Use the same structure you already defined (slightly improved for clarity):

Home / Landing Page

Intro to the system.

Quick buttons: Scan QR, Dashboard, Complaints, Reports.

QR Scanning Simulation Page

Input field for manual QR code entry (string/ID).

Upload dummy QR image option.

On scan → fetch dummy data (linked to vendor form or mock DB).

Display part details: vendor name, lot number, supply date, warranty, last inspection date, status (OK / Warning / Defective).

Complaint Registration Page

Form: fitting ID, issue description, optional file upload.

Save complaints in a dummy dataset.

Inspection & Reports Page

Display dummy inspection data.

AI-simulated alerts like: “High risk detected in Lot #45”.

Reports include: vendor performance, complaint trends, predictive maintenance.

Export dummy data to PDF / CSV.

Dashboard Page

Centralized dashboard with dummy charts:

Inventory overview (count of parts by type).

Graphs (supplier comparison, defect rates, inspections).

Notifications area for simulated smart alerts.

🎨 Design Guidelines

Clean, Material UI or Tailwind dashboard design.

Color codes for part status (Green = OK, Orange = Warning, Red = Defective).

QR code generator should produce a downloadable PNG/SVG.

Dummy data should be preloaded for testing both vendor + official workflows.

⚙️ Notes

No real UDM/TMS integration → all data is dummy/mock.

Ensure role-based login → different UI for Vendor vs Official.

Vendors: Create & Generate QR.

Officials: Scan, Inspect, Report, Dashboard.
